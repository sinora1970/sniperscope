<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Due to

font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Versioning Policy</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>SniperScope
has version code with three parts . Each part is separated by a DOT from other
two parts . The first version is “1.0.0” and any minor versioning is shown in
the right and middle parts . As mentioned above , minor versioning is only for
debugging purposes and does not show a significant change in existing functions
or any new function added . Major versioning on the other hand shows a new
SniperScope app based on previous versions  with probably significant changes
in existing functions or at least one or more new functions . For major versioning
, the left part of version code will be changed . So next major version of
SniperScope after version “1.0.0” and its subversions (for example “1.3.0”)
have “2.0.0” version .</span></p>
